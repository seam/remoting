  <title>Bean Validation</title>
  
  <para>Seam Remoting provides integrated support for JSR-303 Bean Validation, which defines a standard approach for validating
     Java Beans no matter where they are used; web tier or persistence tier, server or client.  Bean validation for remoting 
     delivers JSR-303's vision by making all of the validation constraints declared by the server-side beans available on the 
     client side, and allows developers to perform client-side bean validation in an easy to use, consistent fashion.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Client-side validation by its very nature is an asynchronous operation, as it is possible that the client may encounter
    a custom validation constraint for which it has no knowledge of the corresponding validation logic.  Under these circumstances,
    the client will make a request to the server for the validation to be performed server-side, after which it receives 
    the result will forward it to the client-side callback method.  All built-in validation types defined by the JSR-303
    specification are executed client-side without requiring a round-trip to the server.  It is also possible to provide
    the client-side validation API with custom JavaScript to allow client-side execution of custom validations.

  <section>
    <title>Validating a single object</title>
    
    <para>
      The <literal>Seam.validateBean()</literal> method may be used to validate a single object.  It accepts
      the following parameter values:
    </para>

    <programlisting language="JavaScript"><![CDATA[  Seam.validateBean(bean, callback, groups);]]></programlisting>
    
    <para>
      The <literal>bean</literal> parameter is the object to validate.
    </para>
    
    <para>The <literal>callback</literal> parameter should contain a reference to the callback method to 
      invoke once validation is complete.
    </para>
    
    <para>The <literal>groups</literal> parameter is optional, however may be specified if only certain validation groups
      should be validated.  The <literal>groups</literal> parameter may be a <literal>String</literal> or an array
      of <literal>String</literal> values for when multiple groups are to be validated.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Here's an example showing how a bean called <literal>customer</literal> is validated:
    </para>
    
    <programlisting language="JavaScript"><![CDATA[  function test() {
    var customer = Seam.createBean("com.acme.model.Customer");
    customer.setFirstName("John");
    customer.setLastName("Smith");
    Seam.validateBean(customer, validationCallback);
  }
  
  function validationCallback(violations) {
    if (violations.length == 0) alert("All validations passed!");
  }]]></programlisting>
  
    <tip>
      <para>By default, when Seam Remoting performs validation for a single bean it will traverse the entire object
        graph for that bean and validate each unique object that it finds.  If you don't wish to validate the entire object
        graph, then please refer to the section on validating multiple objects later in this chapter for an alternative.      
      </para>
    </tip>

  <section>
    <title>Validating a single property</title>
    
    <para>Sometimes it might not be desirable to perform validation for all properties of a bean.  For example, you might
      have a dynamic form which displays validation errors as the user tabs between fields.  In this situation, you may use
      the <literal>Seam.validateProperty()</literal> method to validate a single bean property.
    </para>

    <programlisting language="JavaScript">Seam.validateProperty(bean, property, callback)<![CDATA[]]></programlisting>

    <para>The <literal>bean</literal> parameter is the object containing the property that is to be validated.</para>
    
    <para>The <literal>property</literal> parameter is the name of the property to validate.</para>
    
    <para>The <literal>callback</literal> parameter is a reference to the callback function to invoke once the property has
       been validated.
    </para>   
    
    <para>
      Here's an example showing how to validate the <literal>firstName</literal> property of a bean called 
      <literal>customer</literal>:
    </para>
    
    <programlisting language="JavaScript"><![CDATA[  function test() {
    var customer = Seam.createBean("com.acme.model.Customer");
    customer.setFirstName("John");
    Seam.validateProperty(customer, "firstName", validationCallback);
  }
  
  function validationCallback(violations) {
    if (violations.length == 0) alert("All validations passed!");
  }]]></programlisting>     

  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>Validating multiple objects and/or properties</title>    
    
    <para>
      It is also possible to perform multiple validations for beans and bean properties in one go.  This might be useful 
      for example to perform validation of forms that present data from more than one bean.  
      The <literal>Seam.validate()</literal> method takes the following parameters:
    </para>
    
    <programlisting role="JavaScript"><![CDATA[
      Seam.validate(validations, callback, groups);
    ]]></programlisting>    
    
    <para>
      The <literal>validations</literal> parameter should contain a list of the validations to perform.  It may either 
      be an associative array, or an array of associative arrays which define the validations that should be performed.  
      We'll look at this parameter more closely in just a moment.
    </para>
      
    <para>The <literal>callback</literal> parameter should contain a reference to the callback function to invoke once
      validation is complete.  The optional <literal>groups</literal> parameter should contain the group name/s
      for which to perform validation.
    </para>
    
    <para>The <literal>groups</literal> parameter allows one or more validation groups (specified by providing a 
      <literal>String</literal> or array of <literal>String</literal> values) to be validated.  The validation groups
      specified here will be applied to all bean values contained in the <literal>validations</literal> parameter.
    </para>
    
    <para>The simplest example, in which we wish to validate a single object would look like this:</para>
    
    <programlisting role="JavaScript"><![CDATA[
      Seam.validate({bean:customer}, validationCallback);
    ]]></programlisting>
    
    <para>
      In the above example, validation will be performed for the <literal>customer</literal> object, after which
      the function named <literal>validationCallback</literal> will be invoked.
    </para>
